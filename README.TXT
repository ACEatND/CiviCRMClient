For initial documentation and setup, please read the following document:

To use the CE CRM Mobile application with your installation of SugarCRM simply copy
the files and folders to a subdirectory underneath your SugarCRM installation. Then
navigate to that subdirectory from your mobile device. You will be prompted for a login
simply login with the same credentials you use for the web based client.

***** NOTE: This program uses whatever protocol is accessed for the file. So if you access
the file by going to http://www.yoursite.com/sugarcrm/mobile/index.html then you will be
sending your information over the interenet unsecure. The password is encoded client side so
it will never be sent in clear text, however you should always use SSL when accessing mobile
applications.

As jquerymobile continues to progress, we will work to incorporate those changes into this application
hopefully this will lead to 1 version for all platforms.
